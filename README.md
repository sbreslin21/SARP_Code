# SARP_Code
All the code I used for my SARP 2024 Project. Some of the graphs went unused but kept the code in for potential future work.

The data used was taken from the SARP 2021-2022 Flights. I manipulated the data to look at the Long Beach Airport Low Approaches. I specifically wanted to look
at the methane and ethane concentrations to see if I can find a potential source of these gases.

Any Questions please feel free to contact me at seanjb@udel.edu

Investigating Methane and Ethane Emissions in the Long Beach Area
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
As climate change continues to worsen, the investigation and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions has become increasingly
important. Methane, the second most impactful greenhouse gas, has accounted for over 20% of planetary warming since
preindustrial times. Methane emissions primarily originate from biogenic and thermogenic sources, such as dairy farms and
natural gas extraction. Ethane, an abundant hydrocarbon emitted from biomass burning and natural gas, contributes to the
formation of tropospheric ozone. The data for this project was collected in December 2021 and June 2022 aboard the DC-8
aircraft, where whole air samples were taken during low approaches to find potential sources of methane and ethane
emissions. Analysis of these samples using gas chromatography revealed a noticeable increase in methane and ethane
concentrations over Long Beach Airport, an area surrounded by numerous plugged oil and gas wells extracting crude oil and
natural gas. In this study, we observe that methane and ethane concentrations were lower in the summer and higher in the
winter, which can be primarily attributed to seasonal variations in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer height. Our results show
that in both summer and winter campaigns, the ratio of these two gases over the airport was approximately 0.03, indicating
that for every 100 methane molecules, there are 3 ethane molecules. This work identifies methane and ethane hotspots and
provides a critical analysis on potential fugitive emission sources in the Long Beach area. These results emphasize a need to
perform in depth analyses on potential point sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the Long Beach area.
